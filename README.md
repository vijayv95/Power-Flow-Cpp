# Power-Flow-Cpp
This is a repository that I use to study C++.

The aim is to create a piece of software to calculate the bus voltages in a power grid.

## Major issue
**Non convergence** 

## Task in progress
- Verify the gaussian elimination algorithm using example matrices.

### Test case 1 

Input matrix: 

|   |   |   |   |   |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| 1 | 2 | 1 |   | 1 |
| 3 | 5 | 1 |   | 3 |
| 3 | 5 | 1 |   | 3 |

Output:

|   |   |   |   
| - | - | - |
| -2 | 2 | -1 |

## Next task
- Verify the equations for finding the residue.
